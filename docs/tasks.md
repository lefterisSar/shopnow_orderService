# ShopNow Order Service Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvements for the ShopNow Order Service. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture & Design

- [ ] Implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns (controller, service, repository)
- [ ] Create response DTOs to avoid exposing entity objects directly to clients
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions and global exception handler
- [ ] Add pagination and sorting support for list endpoints
- [ ] Implement CQRS pattern for better separation of read and write operations
- [ ] Add event-driven architecture for order status changes

## Security

- [x] Move sensitive configuration to environment variables or a secure vault
- [ ] Strengthen JWT secret and implement proper key rotation
- [ ] Add token expiration validation in JwtTokenUtil
- [ ] Replace System.out.println with proper logging in security components
- [ ] Implement method-level security using @PreAuthorize annotations
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)

## Code Quality

- [ ] Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to all classes and methods
- [ ] Replace direct entity returns with DTOs in controllers and services
- [ ] Add input validation using Bean Validation (JSR 380)
- [ ] Implement proper logging using SLF4J instead of System.out.println
- [ ] Add unit tests for all components (controllers, services, repositories)
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement code style checks (Checkstyle, PMD, etc.)
